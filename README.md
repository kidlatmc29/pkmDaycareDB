# pkmDaycareDB

Hi there! This was a database project for my intro to database class. While I am finished with my class, I plan to refine and add more features to my web application.

There's some of my goals: 
* Create wiki pages that describe my overall process and the specific steps I went through to create this db
  * Also add descriptions of the relations and their attributes
* Work on my web application to be more user friendly with drop down menues and get forms to work
* Move to bootstrap for the UI of my pages
